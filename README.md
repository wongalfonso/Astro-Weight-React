# Astro Weight Calculator

This is one of the first JavaScript projects I have ever worked on. This project really put into perspective how to use and manipulate arrays. The idea behind this application is to let the user enter their weight ,the user then can choose a planet to choose from and it will calculate what your weight would be on that planet. This project was initially written with plain vanilla Javascript and a little bit of jQuery, but I managed to recreate it in React.
